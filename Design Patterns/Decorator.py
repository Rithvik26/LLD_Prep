# Step 1: APIClient Interface
class APIClient(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def request(self, url: str) -> str:
        pass


# Step 2: Concrete Implementation
class BaseAPIClient(APIClient):
    def request(self, url: str) -> str:
        # Simulate random failure
        if random.choice([True, False]):
            raise Exception("Network error!")
        return f"Response from URL:{url}"


# Step 3: Abstract Decorator
class APIClientDecorator(APIClient):
    def __init__(self, client: APIClient):
        self._client = client

    def request(self, url: str) -> str:

# Step 5: Retry Decorator

#Step 6: Caching Decorator

Why This is Good Design

‚úÖ Decorator Pattern ‚Üí we added logging + retry without modifying BaseAPIClient.
‚úÖ Open/Closed Principle ‚Üí extend functionality without changing existing code.
‚úÖ Flexible composition ‚Üí we can mix decorators (Retry + Logging, or Logging only).
‚úÖ Real-world relevance ‚Üí API clients often need cross-cutting concerns like logging, retries, caching, authentication.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Interview Explanation

If asked:

‚ÄúI designed an APIClient interface and a BaseAPIClient. To add extra behaviors like logging and retries, 
I wrapped the base client in decorators LoggingAPIClient and RetryAPIClient. 
These decorators implement the same interface, so they can be composed flexibly. This avoids subclass explosion and respects OCP. A real-world analogy is middleware in HTTP clients ‚Äî we add logging, retry, or caching layers dynamically without touching the base client.‚Äù



1Ô∏è‚É£ Are all SOLID principles used here?

Yes ‚úÖ ‚Äî your decorator example demonstrates almost every SOLID principle:

S ‚Äî Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each decorator has one job:

LoggingAPIClient ‚Üí logging

RetryAPIClient ‚Üí retries

CacheAPIClient ‚Üí caching

No God class mixing all responsibilities.

O ‚Äî Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

You can add new decorators (e.g., AuthAPIClient, RateLimitAPIClient) without modifying existing code.

Your BaseAPIClient doesn‚Äôt change ‚Üí it‚Äôs closed for modification but open for extension via decorators.

L ‚Äî Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Every decorator is still an APIClient.

That means you can pass LoggingAPIClient, RetryAPIClient, or CacheAPIClient anywhere a normal APIClient is expected.

‚úÖ Substitutability holds true.

I ‚Äî Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

APIClient interface has just one method: request().

Clients aren‚Äôt forced to implement unnecessary methods.

‚úÖ Keeps interfaces lean and focused.

D ‚Äî Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

APIClientDecorator depends on the abstraction APIClient, not the concrete BaseAPIClient.

High-level logic (Retry, Logging, Cache) is decoupled from the low-level implementation (network call).

üìå Conclusion: Yes, your decorator stack (Logging + Retry + Cache) is a textbook demonstration of SOLID.
