SOLID PRICIPLES

S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
📌 Definition: A class should have only one reason to change.
Bad: God class ReportGenerator doing generate + format + print.
Good: Split into Report, ReportFormatter, ReportPrinter.
✅ Benefits: modular, testable, easy to extend.

O — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
📌 Definition: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Example: Payment system
Base interface: PaymentMethod (pay())
Implementations: CreditCardPayment, UPIPayment, PayPalPayment
PaymentProcessor depends only on abstraction.
✅ Benefits: Add CryptoPayment without changing processor.


L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
📌 Definition: Subclasses must be replaceable for their parent type without breaking functionality.
In the payment system, any PaymentMethod can replace another in PaymentProcessor.
Violations would be if a subclass removes expected behavior (e.g., Square overriding Rectangle.setHeight() incorrectly).
✅ Benefits: Polymorphism works correctly.


I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
📌 Definition: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they don’t use.
Bad: NotificationService with send_email, send_sms, send_push → clients forced to implement all.
Good: One clean interface NotificationSender.send().
Implementations: EmailSender, SMSSender, PushSender.
✅ Benefits: No fat interfaces, flexible implementations.


D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
📌 Definition: High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.
Example: NotificationService depends on NotificationSender interface, not directly on EmailSender or SMSSender.
Example: Logger depends on LogHandler interface, not directly on ConsoleHandler or FileHandler.
✅ Benefits: Loosely coupled, easy to test, extend.



✅ Quick Memory Hook

S → Single job per class
O → Add new features without changing old code
L → Subclasses must behave like parents
I → Small, specific interfaces
D → Depend on abstractions, not implementations


📌 Interview Tip
When asked:
👉 “How have you applied SOLID principles?”

You can say:
“I’ve practiced each principle with small examples. For instance, SRP with Report split into formatter and printer, OCP+LSP with a payment system, ISP+DIP with a notification system, and DIP with a logger. Each design follows SOLID, making code extensible, testable, and modular.”
