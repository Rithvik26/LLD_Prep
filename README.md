4-Week Daily LLD Prep Plan
Week 1 – Core OOP + SOLID + UML
Day	Task	Problem / Exercise	Language
Day 1	OOP refresh	Implement Shape hierarchy (Circle, Rectangle). Add area calculation.	Python
Day 2	SOLID – SRP	Refactor a God class (ReportGenerator) into separate printer, formatter.	Python
Day 3	SOLID – OCP + LSP	Payment system with multiple payment methods (CreditCard, UPI, PayPal). Use interfaces.	Python
Day 4	UML Practice	Draw class + sequence diagram for Library Management System, then code skeleton.	Python
Day 5	SOLID – ISP + DIP	Design Notification system (Email, SMS, Push). Use DIP for sending.	Python
Day 6	Mock LLD	Design a Logger (INFO, WARN, ERROR). Add file + console output.	Python
Day 7 (Weekend)	Java touchpoint	Re-do Logger system in Java (with interfaces + enums).	Java


Week 2 – Design Patterns Deep Dive
Day	Pattern Focus	Problem / Exercise	Language
Day 8	Singleton + Factory	Connection pool (Singleton). VehicleFactory (Car, Bike).	Python
Day 9	Builder Pattern	Pizza Builder (size, cheese, toppings).	Python
Day 10	Strategy Pattern	Payment Processor with interchangeable strategies (UPI, Wallet).	Python
Day 11	Observer Pattern	Notification System (user subscribes → gets updates).	Python
Day 12	Decorator Pattern	Add logging/retry wrapper around API client.	Python
Day 13	Composite Pattern	File System (Folders contain files/folders).	Python
Day 14 (Weekend)	Java touchpoint	Re-do Observer (Notification System) in Java with interfaces.	Java

.

Week 3 – Classic LLD Problems
Day	Problem	Patterns to Use	Language
Day 15	Parking Lot (multi-level, nearest spot)	Strategy, Singleton (ParkingLot instance).	Python
Day 16	Elevator System	State pattern for elevator.	Python
Day 17	LRU Cache	Doubly Linked List + HashMap.	Python
Day 18	Rate Limiter	Token Bucket / Leaky Bucket.	Python
Day 19	Tic-Tac-Toe	MVC separation.	Python
Day 20	Hotel Booking System	Factory + Strategy + Observer.	Python
Day 21 (Weekend)	Java touchpoint	Re-do Parking Lot skeleton in Java (Spring Boot-style classes).	Java

.

Week 4 – AI/Microservices-Oriented LLD
Day	Problem	Focus	Language
Day 22	RAG Pipeline Orchestration	Retriever (Strategy), Indexer, VectorDBClient.	Python
Day 23	AI Agent Orchestration	Planner, Executor, ToolConnector. Use Command + Observer.	Python
Day 24	Microservice API Design	Expose RAG pipeline as FastAPI service.	Python
Day 25	Spring Boot style	Map same RAG API to Java (Controller → Service → Repo).	Java
Day 26	Circuit Breaker / Retry	Decorator + Resilience pattern.	Python
Day 27	Monitoring / Drift Detection	Observer pattern for event alerts.	Python
Day 28 (Weekend)	Final Mock Interview	Pick 1 random problem (Parking Lot OR RAG pipeline). UML → Python implementation → Java sketch.	Mixed
